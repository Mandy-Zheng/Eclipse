Design Document Revision
Reviewers of our Doc:
    -Raduckal

Concerns:
  -Vagueness about why we chose our forms of data visualization
      -We wanted to display the pie graphs with the percentages of recovery, deaths, and new cases out of total cases
      -We also wanted to use the bar graphs to display the individual data pieces
  -Clarification on how we would use AJAX
      -We are using AJAX to get the data from python routes to javascript
  -Elaboration on Journey of Data Diagram
      -updated the diagram with more specifications on how the data makes it's way from front end to backend
  -Clarify the pop up feature
      -As you move over the graphs, additional information like the exact amount of cases
  -Question about necessity of using flag api
      -We are just using the flag as nice visuals and as a symbol next to the graph

Timeline Adjustment:
    -We decided to increase the amount of countries that we decided to display
    -Moreover we decided that we would have the additional feature of pop ups for each states
    -We also added more things into the extra features we hope to implement
